## Problem

### Too many items

Chef bought $N$ items from a shop. Although it is hard to carry all these items in hand, so Chef has to buy some polybags to store these items.

$1$ polybag can contain at most $10$ items. What is the minimum number of polybags needed by Chef?

### Input Format
- The first line will contain an integer $T$ - number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- The first and only line of each test case contains an integer $N$ - the number of items bought by Chef.
### Output Format

For each test case, output the minimum number of polybags required.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq N \leq 1000$
### Sample 1:

### Explanation:

 **Test case-1:**  Chef will require $2$ polybags. Chef can fit $10$ items in the first and second polybag each.

 **Test case-2:**  Chef will require $3$ polybags. Chef can fit $10$ items in the first and second polybag each and fit the remaining $4$ items in the third polybag.

```c_cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Fast I/O
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    int t;
    cin >> t;
    while (t--) {
        int n;
        cin >> n;
        // (n + 9) / 10 calculates the ceiling of n / 10 using integer division
        cout << (n + 9) / 10 << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```
